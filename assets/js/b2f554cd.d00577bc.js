Now using the Lit Protocol, we are able to manage control to digital assets in a decentralized way. We believe this is the next step in the evolution of digital commerce. \\n\\n![HackHouse Hackathon Group Photo](./konrad-dcom-demoday.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n![HackHouse Hackathon Group Photo](./demo-terrence-2.jpeg)\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nThe next steps are to internally test and audit the MVP. Next to delve deeper into the VRChat community and other digitally native game, art, code and crypto communities that would most benefit from our tool. Once we gain some first interest and early adopters, we will publish our launch on Product Hunt, twitter, and other media platforms. During this time we will also apply for grants from various crypto ecosystems in order to support ourselves which would allo us to dedicate more time to development."}]}')}}]);
