# HackHouse Hackathon Plan

Core Demo Objectives:
1. Inside a web app with a really great UI a user creates a store, then uploads a VRChat Avater for sale.
2. Inside the VR world, a user walks up to a store booth list list of VR Avatars. Adds one to their cart, checks out with crypto and then becomes the avatar.

Brinstorm ideas for other objectives:
- display a visualization of current ethereum and / or polygon transactions and blocks
    - similar to https://txstreet.com/
- have a built in data analysis dashboard for store owners to be able to track their growth, and respond to market 

### Similar existing products:

**DMarket**
They only do crypto payments, but assets are off chain / centralized transferring.
